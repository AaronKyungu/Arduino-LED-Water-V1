# Arduino-LED-Water-V1
This is the V1 of the LED effects I created in collaboration with a student at the Slade School of Fine Art which will be intergrated in a sculpture and credited as part of her degree. It is programmed using C++ in the Arduino IDE. <br />

It has IR remote capabalities, currently being able to play the water effect when pressing the power button on the IR controller. I plan to add more functionality, such as being able to adjust the brightness of the water stream mid-loop, as well as adding more effects and colour palletes. <br />

To run, you will need the FastLED and IRRemote Libraries.
